        <h2>Rooted in Nature, Reaching Through Code</h2>
        <p>She’s a recent graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in Tech Development, passionate about building thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences. With a curious mind and a love for problem-solving, she’s always seeking out new technologies and tools to expand her skills. Whether it’s front-end design or backend logic, she finds joy in turning ideas into functional, elegant solutions.</p>
        <p>Outside the world of tech, she’s someone who thrives on balance. Museums are her happy place — spaces where creativity, culture, and history collide. She can spend hours wandering through exhibitions, learning about everything from ancient civilizations to modern art installations. She’s equally drawn to the quiet beauty of the outdoors. Nature walks help her recharge, offering a welcome contrast to the fast-paced digital world. Whether it's a forest trail or a city park, she finds peace in movement, fresh air, and the sound of birds overhead.</p>
        <p>She has an eye for detail, a love for meaningful conversations, and a deeply caring nature. A quiet observer in group settings, but incredibly thoughtful and insightful once you get to know her. She enjoys cozy evenings with books or indie films, café hopping to find the perfect cup of coffee, and planning spontaneous weekend getaways just to see something new.</p>
        <p>Driven yet grounded, creative yet analytical, she’s someone who brings warmth, intelligence, and intention into everything she does — whether she’s debugging code, planning a trip, or simply enjoying the moment.</p>
